Title: Clean and Analyze Continuous Glucose Monitor Data
Version: 2.7.1
Authors@R: person("Tim", "Vigers", email = "tim.b.vigers@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This code provides several different functions for cleaning and analyzing continuous glucose monitor data. Currently it works with 'Dexcom' (<https://www.dexcom.com>), 'iPro 2' (<http://professional.medtronicdiabetes.com/ipro2-professional-cgm>), Diasend (<https://diasend.com//us>), Libre (<https://www.freestylelibre.us/>) or Carelink (<https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/carelink-personal-diabetes-software>) data. The cleandata() function takes a directory of CGM data files and prepares them for analysis. cgmvariables() iterates through a directory of cleaned CGM data files and produces a single spreadsheet with data for each file in either rows or columns. The column format of this spreadsheet is compatible with REDCap data upload ("--1" is added to each subject ID automatically for double data entry). cgmreport() also iterates through a directory of cleaned data, and produces PDFs of individual and aggregate AGP plots.
